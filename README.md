  <br/>
  Well, hey there! I'm a 23 years old code apprentice, pursuing a career as a Front-end Developer. Advanced Psychology student, mediocre musician, data lover and progressive rock fan. The real embodiment of a Jack of all trades, but master of none.

## What I aim to do 📌

I aim to <strong>create a NFTs e-commerce that unites the new and the old</strong>. Being allowed to travel in time, I'll gather medieval botanical illustrators that wander through the city halls and fairs, while using the new technology that emerged from the blockchain in order to twist the chain of events that will unleash this revolution.
