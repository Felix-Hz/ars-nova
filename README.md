### NFTs Medieval Fair

- :rocket: Sell your NFTs antique helmets, weapons, grains, work utilities and much more.
- üñ•Ô∏è Connect with other nifty-mad men around the world.
- :zap: Join us, dearest and make profits out of your art!

## What I aim to do üìå

I aim to create a <strong>NFTs e-commerce that unites the new and the old</strong>, replicating an old traditional medieval fair. I take the product inspiration from videogames such as RuneScape and AOs, and from movies such as The Lord of the Rings. Being allowed to travel in time, I'll gather medieval items that wander through the city halls and fairs, while using the new technology that emerged from the blockchain to twist the chain of events that will unleash this revolution.
