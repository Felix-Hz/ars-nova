  <br/>
  Well, hey there! I'm a 23 years old code apprentice, pursuing a career as a Front-end Developer. Advanced Psychology student, mediocre musician, data lover and progressive rock fan. The real embodiment of a Jack of all trades, but master of none.

## What I aim to do üìå

I aim to create a <strong>NFTs e-commerce that unites the new and the old</strong>, replicating an old traditional medieval fair. I take the product inspiration from videogames such as RuneScape and AOs, and from movies such as The Lord of the Rings. Being allowed to travel in time, I'll gather medieval items that wander through the city halls and fairs, while using the new technology that emerged from the blockchain to twist the chain of events that will unleash this revolution.
